# PayPredict  

PayPredict is a machine learningâ€“based web app that estimates salaries by combining structured information (experience, education, location) with unstructured text (resume + job description).  
The app uses Streamlit for the interface and a trained regression model to generate predictions.

## Project Overview  

The idea behind PayPredict is simple: salaries depend not only on years of experience or degree, but also on the actual skills mentioned in a resume and the requirements of a job description.  

This project brings those pieces together:  

- Text Understanding: resumes and job descriptions are converted into vector embeddings using a transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).  
- Structured Features: experience, education level, and job location are processed with preprocessing tools (scaler + one-hot encoder).  
- Prediction Model: a regression model trained on synthetic data estimates the expected salary.  
- Interactive Web App: Streamlit provides a simple interface for uploading files and viewing predictions.
